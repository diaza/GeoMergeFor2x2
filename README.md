# What is this?

This repository contains code (originally by Callum) and input GDMLs for
building the merged 2x2 + MINERvA geometry.

# What do I need?

You need the `pyg4ometry` package, which can be installed via `pip`. Be warned,
the installation will use every core on your machine to compile the necessary
C++ libraries.

# What do I do?

Run, for example, `pyg4_mod_and_add_newMINERvA.py`.
